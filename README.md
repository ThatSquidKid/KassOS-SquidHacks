# KassOS
This is was an old project that I started last year but stopped. After doing a poll on YouTube, I decided to pick the project back up and work more on it. I am opening to colabing so let me know if you want to colab. If you wish to colab, join the discord server. https://discord.gg/XP7JxVBHA2

Project is now managed under Tech Cavern

# Hardware
This does work on both VMs and Real Hardware. If you wish to use it on real hardware, you can use a tool such as rufus to write it on a usb or another type of drive. At the moment, it has only been tested on QEMU, VitrualBox (I suggest using QEMU) , SSDs, USBs, and SD cards. I do not know about hdmi or display ports, but I do now it displays using VGA. If you test it on other stuff, please tell me if it worked or not. I am not responsible if your stuff stops working after using the OS. 

## Commands
Only commands at the moment is clear, info, version, and a help command.
OS does restart when you press ctrl+p
Apparently bytes limits get in the way
